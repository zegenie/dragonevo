	<h6>Is Dragon Evo:TCG a "Facebook game"?</h6>
	<p>
		The term "Facebook game" is not descriptive for the type of game we're making. As almost all games labelled "Facebook games", the game itself will be playable in your web browser - but there is no integration with the Facebook API. We will add the ability to log in / register with your Facebook account to simplify the signup process, but that will be just one of several options to log in and register. Our target audience are CCG and action card game fans who want a great online CCG experience.
